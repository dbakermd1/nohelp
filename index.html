      <div id="content"><h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an IT Professional, Gamer, Novice Photoshop person, Self-taught video editor, Podcast host, Social Media Manager and a Sr. Staff Memember of Konsole Kingz.</p>
      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I started out in IT after a long career in retail at Lowe's Home Improvement. I started at Advanced Career Training in Jacksonville, FL. I always feared computers but saw how the industry was growing and decided to jump in on it. I worked my way up in CSX Technology and from there moved to Baltimore with CSX. I've had various other jobs in the IT field in the DC, Maryland and Northern, VA area (DMV). I have a strong passion for gaming and the entire gamin industry. I work for <a href="http://konsolekingz.com/" class="link">Konsole Kingz</a> which is based out of Atlanta. Konsole Kingz is a leader of the urban video gaming space. We focus on a unique combination of promotions, event planning, gaming tournaments, viral marketing, and editorial pieces to connect with the urban gamer. From working with KKZ I have developed and even stronger passion for social media and the entertainment industry. I want to be in this business and be able to do it all. Build my PC, build my websites, create content, market various products and promote them like a boss</p>
      <h2>Why I Decided To Learn The Program</h2>
      <p>I decided to join the program after a buddy of mine, Gerard Williams aka HipHop Gamer. I hit him up and after he mentioned I should get in touch with Calvin I did. I have been getting job offers that required .Net, JavaScript or SQL and I had to decline. I decided to stand my ground and not run from this to better my IT career. I sent Calvin a text and boom....I'm here</p></div>
